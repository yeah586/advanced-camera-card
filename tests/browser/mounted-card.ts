 * which wait it was that never finished.
 *
 * Known limitation: the browser reports changes within a root being watched,
 * never the creation of a root itself. A new root is picked up because whatever
 * created it also changed a watched root; one created with nothing else
 * changing around it would be missed until the timeout. Everything the card
